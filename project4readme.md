# Project 04 - Zillow

Present things learned from clustering in the Zillow database
- what we learned about the domain
- what we learned about clustering
- what we learned about data science

Target: logerror
Goal: Help Zillow imporve Zestimate

1. Audience: Class, Fellow Learners

2. Deliver Notebook w/supporting files
    - Clean
    - Easy to read
    - Separated .py files

3. Team of 2

4. Clustering:
    a). Clusters --> Features
    b). Clustering for exploration (categorical grouping)
    c). Clustering of target (binning)

5. Analysis / Takeaways + Modeling
    - must have a model
    - aim of model is to predict log error


General process:
1. Acquire
2. Initial features
3. Drop extraneous variables
4. Split
    - Impute after split before scaling
5. Scale
6. Explore
6. Statistical testing
6. Visualizing
6. Clustering

There must be Statistical Testing, Visualization of Clusters, Model(s), Summary of Key Drivers of Target, Encoding, Modeling
