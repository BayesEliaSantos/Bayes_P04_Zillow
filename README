Goal: Improve our original estimate of the log error by using clustering methodologies.

3 features to focus on:
    1- Location(zipcode -> Section -> Neighborhood)
    2- Lot size
    3- Livable Squarefeet (calculated squarefeet- ((number of bedrooms* bedroom size) + (bathroom count * bathroom size))


Acquisition 
Pulled from zillow SQL Database


Prep

Baseline- Bathroom count, Bedroom count, and square feet =====> Target: Logerror
    -Get rid of values with zero
    -Ran remove_outliers_iqr to find and remove outliers

MVP



Split

Baseline- Split our baseline data (bathrooms, bedrooms and squarefeet with Logerror)

Initial Exploration

Baseline-
    -Will run a elbow test to determine optimal number of clusters for visualization of the Baseline
    - Will have a Pairplot and a 2D scatter to show clusters 
    


Exploration with Clustering- Target(y) = LOGERROR



Cluster Independent Variables


 1- Location(zipcode -> Section -> Neighborhood)
    2- Lot size
    3- Livable Squarefeet
